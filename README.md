# TicTacToe – Capstone Project

## Description

TicTacToe is a classic two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create three marks in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game can also end in a draw if the board is full without a winner.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – for structuring the game board, buttons, and UI elements.
* **CSS** – for styling the layout, colors, and overall visual design.
* **JavaScript** – for the game logic: player turns, win detection, draw detection, and reset functionality.

## Features

* Interactive 3x3 game board.
* Players can alternately select empty squares.
* Automatic detection of winners or draw results.
* Reset button to start a new game.
* Simple interface, easily playable in a browser.
